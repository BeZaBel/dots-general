# Dots general

Some dotfiles for stuff like fish, wezterm, neovim, i3wm and herbstluftwm.

Not finished, will be updating.

Almost everything uses the [Rosé Pine](https://github.com/rose-pine) colorscheme.
Including the GTK theme that is available in the Rosé Pine repo under [gtk](https://github.com/rose-pine/gtk)

Firefox is using the [Rosé Pine theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rose-pine/) available from the firefox add-ons store.
The css file is just to make it a simple one liner.

Wezterm uses the Rosé Pine colorscheme with a gradient in the background.

Bar is [polybar](https://polybar.github.io) and [polydock](https://github.com/folke/polydock).

I use a multimonitor setup. Due to how i3wm and herbstluft work, the setup looks a little bit different in either wm: polydock is fully extended in the monitor on the left in i3wm, while in herbstluftwm is on top of polybar. Why? I don't know and don't really care, since I like it still.
